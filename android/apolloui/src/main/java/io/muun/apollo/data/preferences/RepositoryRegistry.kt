/**
 * Welcome to RepositoryRegistry! This is class is meant to be a centralized, singleton registry
 * for all preferences repositories. Why do we need it? The idea is to invert the way of doing this
 * and to only have to manually or carefully update the list of repositories NOT to clear and that
 * way every repository (except for the exceptions hehe) will be cleared by default.
 *
 * As to why one strategy is better than the other: delete by default makes for a better security
 * default. Most data we store is tied to a session or user. If another user logins, they should not
 * have access to another users data. This way, we are forced to do sth only for the unusual case
 * (ie we want to keep that data) instead of the usual (rm -rf).
 *
 * Since we are still forced to manually keep a list of ALL repositories, we came up with the idea
 * of having a static list of all the repositories classes, and having BaseRepository (the class
 * which every repository should extend from), load the repository here upon its creation.
 * That way if we forget to add a new repository to this list, build will quickly fail upon running.
 * This is the simplest and "closest to a linter/static check" solution we could came up with.
 *
 * Note: this class is used a @Singleton. Check out its provider method in { @link DataModule }.

    // may instantiate more than one instance of the same repository if its not annotated with

    // reference of the repository and allow "older" references/instances to be properly garbage
    // collected. This help prevents leaks of other objects which can't be GCed because they held
