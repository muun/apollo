/*
 * Well you might wonder why this exists!
 * The HoustonUuidDao / BaseDao assume that the model itself is enough to store in the DB. For most
 * models this is ok, but Htlcs have a foreign key to the swap, but the model itself doesn't. We'd
 * like to pass it as parameter or have the incoming swap handle the storing of the htlc. We can't
 * do that without a serious refactor, so we add this model to avoid the issue entirely.
