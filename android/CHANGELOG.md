# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and we also try to
follow [https://changelog.md/](https://changelog.md/) guidelines.

## [Unreleased]

## [51.11] - 2024-05-18

### FIXED

- Removed debug log of sensitive data

## [51.10] - 2024-05-17

### ADDED

- Background notification processing reliability improvements

### CHANGED

- Made outpoints and utxoStatus available to Libwallet's PaymentAnalyzer. Which involved a client
data migration to init utxos' status.
- Enhanced crashes and error reports with extra metadata.
- Include swap_uuid in newop events for better lightning payments metrics.
- Notify logout upon security logout (e.g 3 incorrect pin attempts).

### FIXED

- Fixed ANRs happening when trying to send a email error report.
- Adjusted overly verbose logging in release.
- Fixed problems and crashes in devices where VES currency is not supported.

## [51.9] - 2024-04-30

- Background notification processing reliability improvements

## [51.8] - 2024-02-23

### CHANGED
- Made the payment address (aka payment secret) flag required in our invoices (and also
the TLV onion as payment secret depends on it). Having the flag as optional was causing some strict
services to block zero amount invoices from Muun. If the secret is optional, the last hop (us) can
forward a fake sphinx without a payment secret and for 1 sat, the app will accept it since the
secret is optional and the last hop keeps the rest of the payment. Payment secret has been widely
adopted for quite a bit now. Major impls all require it.

## [51.7] - 2024-01-24

### FIXED

- A crash when trying to change password using Recovery Code
- A probable source of crashes regarding handling of MuunHeader

### CHANGED

- Bump kotlin version and make it match with kotlin android gradle plugin version.

  instead of Bitcoin (SAT).
- Silence noisy DRM errors.
- Huge revamp to UI test suite. Enhancing reliability and coverage.
